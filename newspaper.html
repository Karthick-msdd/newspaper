                                There was no 90-metre magic but Neeraj Chopra claimed his first title of the 2025 season with a win at the Paris Diamond League on Friday, June 20.
                                Neeraj secured the win with his first attempt of 88.16 m as it was enough to keep Julian Weber's challenge at bay. Neeraj could only get three valid throws on the night
                                but it was enough in the end to claim the win.

                    on Friday night with an impressive first-round throw of 88.16m, in a star-studded line-up that included five members of the elite 90m club.
                    Chopra followed up his first effort with 85.10m, before registering three consecutive fouls. He closed with a modest 82.89m on his final attempt.
                    Weber, who had beaten Chopra in two previous outings this season, finished second with his best of 87.88m, also coming in the first round. Brazil's Luiz Mauricio da Silva took third with 86.62m in the third round.
                    The victory was Chopra's first since Lausanne 2023, when he won with 87.66m. In the interim, he had finished runner-up in six Diamond League meetings, often falling just short of the top spot. 
                    This triumph also marked his maiden win in Paris, where he had made his Diamond League debut back in 2017. Then a junior world champion, Chopra had placed fifth with 84.67m.
                    Also, when I started my Wanda Diamond League career, I started here in Paris, so it is my second time here after my debut in 2017. After seven or eight years, I am happy with the win here. For me consistency is the biggest key. 
                    Yet, sometimes when you are competing in events like World Championships, the Olympics or some other big events, you need to be able to win in tough conditions, and under pressure. I am very happy to win here amongst so many great athletes. 
                    The guys throw really far and I am happy with my consistency, and I am hoping to be able to throw 90 metres in more competitions."
                    The Paris Olympic silver medallist had surpassed the 90m barrier earlier in the season at the Doha leg of the Diamond League on 16 May, recording a throw of 90.23m to finish second. Weber had claimed the title there with a final-round effort of 91.06m.</div>

                                 He has even been asked to keep wickets. He does that for the team, and that's what you want in the team. You see the way he reacts to the situation. He's got an equanimity about him
                                 which is so rare because in today's day and age where everybody's got to be doing things to show that they have achieved something, his celebrations are also muted. One thing everybody agrees about KL Rahul is that he doesn't know how good a player he is. 
                                 I mean, he would agree," said Gavaskar.KL Rahul has got so much talent'Gavaskar said that Rahul has got so much talent and a wide array of shots in his arsenal, but the Indian opener hasn't lived up to the hype.
                                 "He's got so much talent. Look at all the shots on the offside, leg-side, the flick, everything. All the shots, but he hasn't lived up to that. Now, that could be a bit of self-doubt in his mind or whatever that sometimes keeps the Bangalore boys from fulfilling their potential," 
                                 said Gavaskar Speaking about his strokeplay, Gavaskar said it was thrilling to watch Rahul on Day 3 and claimed he can keep raving about the Indian opener's cover drive. The Indian legend also said that he hopes Rahul comes good in the series and gets close to 700 runs in the series.
                                 "Thrilling to watch off the front foot, off the back foot, then the straight batter drive, which we saw just now and the cover drive. I can rave about that cover drive because there's perfection in that."
                                 "I hope that he comes good in this series and scores over 500, maybe 700 runs. That would be fantastic from India".Ravi Shastri was critical of India's fielding efforts in the Leeds Test, saying that they should have had a 150-plus lead at the end of England's first innings. 
                                The Indian fielders gave the likes of Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, and Harry Brook lifelines in Leeds, and England ultimately conceded just a six-run lead.</div>

                                  Lionel Messi To Face PSG After Inter Miami And Palmeiras Draw To Go Through Lionel Messi in action© AFPLionel Messi faces a reunion with his former club Paris Saint-Germain after his Inter Miami side reached the last 16 of the Club World Cup with a 2-2 draw with Palmeiras. 
                                  The Brazilian side fought back from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw at Hard Rock Stadium, a result which secured both teams a place in the knock-out stages. Goals from Tadeo Allende and Luis Suarez had Miami on course for a second surprise victory in the tournament after their win over Porto.
                                  But the Brazilian side struck twice in the last 10 minutes through Paulinho and Mauricio to make sure of their place in the next round.Few expected Miami to make it out of the group but they now face the European champions while Palmeiras will have an all-Brazilian encounter with Botofogo.
                                  For Messi, who celebrates his 38th birthday on Tuesday, the tie in Atlanta will see him face his former club PSG for the first time since leaving them to join Miami in 2023.The result meant that Egyptian club Al Ahly and Porto were both eliminated despite producing a highly entertaining 4-4 draw at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
                                  There were six Argentines in the Miami starting line-up which took the field in front of a large Brazilian contingent in the 60,914 crowd.The travelling fans were on their feet in the opening minutes when Gustavo Gomez powered a header goalwards from a corner but Oscar Ustari was down well to save.
                                  Miami grabbed the lead in the 16th minute when Suarez brilliantly chested a long ball into the path of the on-rushing Allende who showed pace to break clear of the Brazilian defence and then composure to fire past Weverton. </div>
